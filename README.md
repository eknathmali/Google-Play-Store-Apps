# Google-Play-Store Apps
1. I have made the analysis of apps across the world on the basis of apps category, apps ratings, user reviews.
2. In this Project, I have Used Python libraries such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org),[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org),
      [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org),[plotly](https://plotly.com)  for Manipulation, Analysis, and Visualization of the app's data.
3. I hope this project would have helped android developers they have got an idea about which apps should be made and which precautions should 
   be taken.
4. I have used the real apps dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
5. I hope you liked it.  <h1>Thank You</h1>1. I have made the analysis of apps across the world on the basis of apps category, apps ratings, user reviews.
